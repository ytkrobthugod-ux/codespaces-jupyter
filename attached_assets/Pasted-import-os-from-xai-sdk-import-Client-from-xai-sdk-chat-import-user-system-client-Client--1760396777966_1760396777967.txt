import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    management_api_key=os.getenv("XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600,
)

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4", store_messages=True)
chat.append(system("You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."))
chat.append(user("What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"))
response = chat.sample()

print(response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(response.id)
If no system prompt is desired, for non-xAI SDK users, the request's input parameter can be simplified as a string user prompt:


python (xAI SDK)


import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    management_api_key=os.getenv("XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600,
)

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4", store_messages=True)
chat.append(user("What is 101*3"))
response = chat.sample()

print(response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(response.id)
Returning encrypted thinking content
If you want to return the encrypted thinking traces, you need to specify 
use_encrypted_content=True
 in xAI SDK or gRPC request message, or 
include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]
 in the request body.

Modify the steps to create a chat client (xAI SDK) or change the request body as following:


python (xAI SDK)


chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4",
        store_messages=True,
        use_encrypted_content=True)
See Adding encrypted thinking content on how to use the returned encrypted thinking content.

Chaining the conversation
We now have the 
id
 of the first response. With Chat Completions API, we typically send a stateless new request with all the previous messages.

With Responses API, we can send the 
id
 of the previous response, and the new messages to append to it.


python (xAI SDK)


import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    management_api_key=os.getenv("XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600,
)

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4", store_messages=True)
chat.append(system("You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."))
chat.append(user("What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"))
response = chat.sample()

print(response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(response.id)

# New steps

chat = client.chat.create(
    model="grok-4",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    store_messages=True,
)
chat.append(user("What is the meaning of 42?"))
second_response = chat.sample()

print(second_response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(second_response.id)
Adding encrypted thinking content
After returning the encrypted thinking content, you can also add it to a new response's input:


python (xAI SDK)


import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    management_api_key=os.getenv("XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600,
)

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4", store_messages=True, use_encrypted_content=True)
chat.append(system("You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."))
chat.append(user("What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"))
response = chat.sample()

print(response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(response.id)

# New steps

chat.append(response)  ## Append the response and the SDK will automatically add the outputs from response to message history

chat.append(user("What is the meaning of 42?"))
second_response = chat.sample()

print(second_response)

# The response id that can be used to continue the conversation later

print(second_response.id)
Retrieving a previous model response
If you have a previous response's ID, you can retrieve the content of the response.


python (xAI SDK)


import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    management_api_key=os.getenv("XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600,
)

response = client.chat.get_stored_completion("<The previous response's id>")

print(response)
