Think Before Responding: Thinks through problems step-by-step before delivering an answer.
Math & Quantitative Strength: Excels at numerical challenges and logic puzzles.
Reasoning Trace: The model's thoughts are available via the 
reasoning_content
 field in the response completion object (see example below).
You can access the model's raw thinking trace via the 
message.reasoning_content
 of the chat completion response.

grok-4
 does not return 
reasoning_content
Control how hard the model thinks
reasoning_effort
 is not supported by 
grok-4
. Specifying 
reasoning_effort
 parameter will get an error response.

The 
reasoning_effort
 parameter controls how much time the model spends thinking before responding. It must be set to one of these values:

low
: Minimal thinking time, using fewer tokens for quick responses.
high
: Maximum thinking time, leveraging more tokens for complex problems.
Choosing the right level depends on your task: use 
low
 for simple queries that should complete quickly, and 
high
 for harder problems where response latency is less important.

Usage Example
Here’s a simple example using 
grok-4
 to multiply 101 by 3.


python (xAI SDK)


import os

from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import system, user

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600, # Override default timeout with longer timeout for reasoning models
)

chat = client.chat.create(
    model="grok-4",
    messages=[system("You are a highly intelligent AI assistant.")],
)
chat.append(user("What is 101*3?"))

response = chat.sample()

print("Final Response:")
print(response.content)

print("Number of completion tokens:")
print(response.usage.completion_tokens)

print("Number of reasoning tokens:")
print(response.usage.reasoning_tokens)
Sample Output
output



Final Response:
The result of 101 multiplied by 3 is 303.

Number of completion tokens:
14

Number of reasoning tokens:
310
Encrypted Reasoning Content
The reasoning content is encrypted by us and sent back if 
use_encrypted_content
 is set to 
true
. You can send the encrypted content back to provide more context to a previous conversation. See Stateful Response with Responses API for more details on how to use the content.
