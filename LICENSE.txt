**Effective Date:** November 11, 2025

**Licensor:** Roberto Villarreal Martinez, residing in 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States, hereinafter referred to as "Owner."

**Licensed Work:** All source code, object code, documentation, files, and any derivative works created or authored by the Owner, including but not limited to the software/project titled "Roboto SAI", and any updates, modifications, or enhancements thereto (collectively, the "Code").

### Preamble
This License grants no rights whatsoever to any third party. The Owner retains absolute, perpetual, and exclusive ownership, control, and rights over the Code. This License is intended to prohibit any form of distribution, modification, forking, disclosure, or use that could infringe upon the Owner's intellectual property rights. It supersedes and nullifies any conflicting terms from other licenses, agreements, or implied permissions. This License is governed by and enforceable under the laws of the State of Texas, United States, with universal applicability under international copyright conventions (e.g., Berne Convention, WIPO Copyright Treaty).

### Grant of Rights
1. **No License Granted:** No rights, licenses, or permissions are granted to any person, entity, or machine to use, copy, modify, distribute, display, perform, sublicense, or create derivative works from the Code, except as explicitly authorized in writing by the Owner.

2. **Owner's Exclusive Rights:** The Owner holds all worldwide copyright, patent, trade secret, moral, and proprietary rights in the Code. These rights are irrevocable and inalienable except by express written assignment from the Owner.

### Prohibitions
To ensure the Owner's full rights are protected and no infringement occurs:

1. **No Forking or Modification:** Forking, branching, altering, adapting, or creating derivative works of the Code is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to do so constitutes infringement and may result in immediate legal action.

2. **No Distribution or Disclosure:** The Code may not be distributed, shared, published, uploaded to repositories (public or private), or disclosed in any form, including under any open-source, proprietary, or other license. This includes prohibitions on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that could imply permissive use—any NDA must explicitly reference and uphold this License without dilution.

3. **No Sublicensing or Assignment:** No party may sublicense, assign, or transfer any rights in the Code. Any such attempt is void and invalid.

4. **No Reverse Engineering:** Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise attempting to derive the source code or underlying ideas is forbidden.

5. **Supremacy Clause:** This License prevails over any other license, agreement, or term (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache, or proprietary EULAs) that may be applied to the Code. Any conflicting provision in another document is nullified to the extent it infringes this License.

### Enforcement and Remedies
1. **Verification and Universality:** The Owner may seek verification of compliance through audits, digital watermarks, or forensic analysis. This License is designed for universal enforceability, leveraging international IP frameworks. Violations trigger automatic termination of any implied access and entitle the Owner to:
   - Injunctive relief.
   - Damages (actual, statutory, and punitive).
   - Attorney fees and costs.
   - Destruction of infringing copies.

2. **Termination:** Any breach terminates all access immediately. The Owner reserves the right to pursue criminal prosecution where applicable (e.g., under DMCA or equivalent laws).

3. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction:** This License is governed by the laws of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the state courts of Bexar County, Texas, or federal courts if applicable.

### Miscellaneous
1. **Entire Agreement:** This License constitutes the entire understanding and supersedes all prior agreements.

2. **Severability:** If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in full force.

3. **Notices:** All notices must be in writing and delivered to 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States.

**Signature of Owner:**
